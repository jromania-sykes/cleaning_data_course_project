####Original Data set 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
Refer to the documentation above for description of the source files.

###Source Data

The following tables are loaded from the dataset listed above.  Please review the information in the above dataset for more detail on the source data and project.

- activity_labels - Name mapping for activities performed by the subjects.  (1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS..for example).

- features - A table of column names for the measurments taken.  (tBodyAcc-XYZ,
tGravityAcc-XYZ,tBodyAccJerk-XYZ)

- X_test - The measurement matrix for the 'Test' group.
- Y_test - Activity mapping for the data in X_test. 
- subject_test - Mapping of the subject that was performing the activity for the measurement in X_test.

- X_train - The measurement matrix for the 'Train' group.
- Y_train - Activity mapping for the data in X_train. 
subject_train - Mapping of the subject that was performing the activity for the measurement in X_train.

###Algorithms

The following steps are performed by **get_tidy_wearables** data function in the 
run_analysis.R.

####get_tidy_wearables
Transform the source tables into a tidy data set as defined by

Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

####method

- load global tables : activity_labels, features,
- load 'train' and 'test' data sets.  X_test, Y_test, X_train, Y_train
- set column names for X_train and X_test to for the 561 measurements included in each sample (i.e.  Column names)
- Add the activity and subject columns to the X_train and X_test tables.  This adds the subject who was begin measured and the activity they were performing when the measurement was taken.
- combine the the Test and Train tables into the combined_test_train data frame.
- As per the instructions extract just the mean and std columns (leaving the activity and subject columns) from the combined_test_train into the mean_std_combined table.
- strip funky characters out of the column names (IE, '(','(','-',..) these cause problems with the dplyr specification used for the summary tables created 

####get_tidy_mean_by_activity_wd
creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity.

 <- function(mean_std_combined) {
    mean_by_activity=mean_std_combined %>% group_by(activity) %>% summarise_each(funs(mean(.,na.rm=TRUE)), -subject)
    }

####get_mean_by_subject_wd <- function(mean_std_combined)
